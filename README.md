Goal helps you achieve your goals by using strategy and tactics straight from your terminal.

> Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat. â€” Sun Tzu.

Have you ever seen someone, for example you :-), being or at least appearing busy but not really getting anywhere? If you don't know where you are going, you're going nowhere. You need a goal. If you have a goal but haven't thought about how to achieve it, you will get lost. You need a strategy. If you have strategy you need to get going. You need tactics.
